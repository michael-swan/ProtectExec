# TODO
 1. Exhaust SquashFS related features, such as suid flag and file capabilities that could lead to a breach in security.
 2. Add `file(1)`-style check of the SquashFS file.
 3. Add check of SquashFS support in kernel-space. Try to modprobe if not found.
 4. Add check that path corresponds with a cgroup file system.
 5. Write losetup.c
